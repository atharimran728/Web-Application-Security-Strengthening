# Web-Application-Security-Strengthening
This repository contains materials from the DevelopersHub.co June 2025 internship, focusing on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in a user management web application.
## Project Overview
This project provided hands-on experience in cybersecurity, involving the assessment of a web application for common vulnerabilities and the subsequent implementation of essential security enhancements. The goal was to build practical skills in web application security.
## Key Project Phases
The internship covered three main areas:
### Security Assessment
Initial analysis of a mock web application to identify vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), weak password handling, and basic security misconfigurations. Findings were documented for remediation planning.
### Implementing Security Measures

Focused on fixing identified vulnerabilities and enhancing the application's security posture. This included:

 - Input Validation and Sanitization: Protecting against injection attacks.
 - Password Hashing: Securing user credentials.
 - Token-Based Authentication: Improving user session security.
 - HTTP Header Security: Strengthening data transmission.

### Advanced Security & Reporting

Involved basic penetration testing, setting up application logging for security monitoring, and compiling a checklist of web security best practices. The project concluded with a comprehensive report and a video explanation.

## Technologies Used

Vulnerability Scanning: `OWASP ZAP`, `Browser Developer Tools`.

Development & Security Libraries: `Node.js`, `validator.js`, `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, `helmet`, `winston`.
